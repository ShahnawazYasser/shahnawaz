                            <p>Hello! Im Shahnawaz, a Pakistan/Northern Cyprus based freelancer. 
                                I do not work with freelancing organizations as they charge more than required. 
                                Thats why I started my own practice; so people can have a choice.
                            </p>
                            <p>I have a diverse set of skills including Web design, 
                                front-end development with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. 
                                I also create WordPress powered websites for those 
                                who do not need a highly customized website.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
    )
